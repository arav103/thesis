### Additional information

Not all documents have the same release date, because of the following:

Two errata have been released for part 2 of the OCPP 2.0.1 specification.:“OCPP-2.0.1_part2_errata_v1_0” was released in 2021. 
In 2022 this version 1 document was *extended* with additional errata entries in “OCPP-2.0.1_part2_errata_v2_0”.
These errata have been incorporated in “OCPP-2.0.1_part2_specification_edition2”, such that it is no longer
necessary to read the errata in addition to the “OCPP-2.0.1_part2_specification” (edition 1). The incorporation of the errata in edition 2 does not affect any
schemas of OCPP messages. Certain errata did contain changes to requirements or even new requirements, but only in cases
where a requirement contains an obvious error and would not or could not be implemented literally. New requirements were only
added when they were already implicitly there. These changes have been discussed in or were proposed by the Technology
Working Group of the Open Charge Alliance.

The appendices of the OCPP 2.0.1 part 2 can be updated without requiring a new OCPP release. This mainly concerns the
components and variables of the OCPP device model, which can be extended with new components or variables, as long as they
are optional.

The “OCPP-2.0.1_part2_errata_v2_0” document can be download separately at the `OCPP 2.0.1 (part 2 edition 1 + errata)` download link.

On 2023-06-30 the following documents were added to the set:
- OCPP-2.0.1_part2_edition2_errata - these are the errata applicable to OCPP 2.0.1 part 2 edition 2, that will be later merged in OCPP 2.0.1 part 2 edition 3
- OCPP-2.0.1_part5_certification_profiles - the certification profiles for Core & Advanced Security. The remaining certification profiles will be added in a later release of this part.
- OCPP-2.0.1_part6_test_cases - the test cases for Core & Advanced Security that are used during certification. The test cases for the remaining certification profiles will be added in a later release of this part.
